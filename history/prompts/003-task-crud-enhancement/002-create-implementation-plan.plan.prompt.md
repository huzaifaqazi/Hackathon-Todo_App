## Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the task CRUD enhancement feature, including research findings, data model, API contracts, and quickstart guide. The plan outlines the technical architecture for implementing View, Update, and Delete operations for tasks while ensuring proper authentication and authorization.

## Response
Completed the implementation planning phase by creating:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Outlined the overall approach, technical context, and project structure for the task CRUD enhancement
2. Research Document (research.md): Documented key decisions regarding backend API implementation, frontend enhancements, authentication strategy, error handling, and database consistency
3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined the Task entity with fields, validation rules, relationships, and state transitions
4. API Contracts (contracts/tasks-api.yaml): Created OpenAPI specification for task endpoints (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with proper authentication and error handling
5. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Provided setup instructions, API documentation, and development commands

The plan ensures compliance with the constitution requirements and sets up the proper architecture for implementing the missing View, Update, and Delete task features.
